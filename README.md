## How to develop

Some general guidelines

- A notebook covers a single concept or application
- Try to be as basic as possible. Put advanced usages at the end, and allow reader to skip it.
- Keep the cell outputs on the notebooks so that readers can see the results without running
- Organize frequenlty asked questions on the [mxnet's issue](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues) into notebooks.
